                Like any other online business, we need money to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                We have a staff of developers that work on HighlightsToWatch, who are developing all features on this site. Apart from paying to the staff, we also have to cover hosting bills. So we must make money to cover our operating costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                We make money primarily through advertisements and sponsored posts. Aside from that we also use affiliate links in our blog posts, but you should know we only promote products that we have used and are helpful to HighlightsToWatch users.
